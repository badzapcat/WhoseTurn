This is an app for keeping track of whose turn it is to pay for things between two close people. (for example, if you're eating out with your friend and it's most convenient for one person to pay.

This is for people who don't want to deal with actual exchanges of money, and
just want to take turns paying for things in a fair manner. It's also for people
who are offended by matters of money, and so the app won't even report _how
much_ is owed, just who ought to pay next.

This app is currently a work-in-progress, as it only runs locally on one phone.
The imagined future of this app is to sync between a pair of phones using NFC.
No guarantees it will ever become that, though.
